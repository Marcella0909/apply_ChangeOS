# apply_ChangeOS
This repository aims to apply the ChangeOS framework (Building damage assesment with a deep object-based semantic change detection framework) for a natural disaster that was not covered in the respective study (Haiti Earth Quake, 2010). 

The data was acquired via the Maxar/DigitalGlobe Open Data Program. The pre- and post-disaster images were preprocessed using Q-GIS. The following pre-processing steps were conducted:
- Crop images to cover the same region
- Georeferencing & pixel alignment 
- Resize to fit the models input size (via python)

The results are not accurate. This is probably due to poor image quality.
